If you head to the backcountry, consider sharing your photos and observations with the Mountain Information Network!\nSnowpack Summary A widespread layer of new surface hoar is growing in the region. It is not currently a concern, but it may become problematic once buried by new snow.Otherwise, a firm surface crust caps the snowpack, potentially melting slightly in the afternoon on directly sunny slopes. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled with several crust layers present, though none are affecting stability at this time. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Wednesday NightMostly clear skies with valley cloud possible. 20 km/h northwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -9 °C.ThursdayMix of sun and clouds with valley cloud possible. 10 km/h northwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -13 °C.FridayMostly sunny. 20 km/h northeast ridgetop wind.

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Thursday January 22, 2025 11:15 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: Trapped low level moisture (due to a temperature inversion and persistent stagnant airmass should maintain low cloud, fog patches and local light flurries this morning. Increased wind and a few flurries are possible later this afternoon and tonight as the leading edge of a modified Arctic airmass attempts to push just west of Alberta. Surface based high pressure of modified Arctic origin centred east of the Rockies and also beginning to build southward from northern BC should allow for mainly sunny/clear skies Friday and into Friday night. A minor disturbance drifting southward along the Rockies could provide a few light flurries again later Friday night. The temperature should trend colder tonight through Friday night.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface. \n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy with fog patches and a few light flurries during the morning. Cloudy with possible sunny breaks and a 50% chance of flurries during the afternoon. Minor accumulation possible. Increasing wind during the afternoon. High near -9.\n\nTONIGHT: Mainly cloudy with a 60% chance of flurries during the evening, minor accumulation possible. Clearing overnight. Windy at times. Low near -15.\n\nFRIDAY: Mainly sunny. Windy at times, mainly during the morning. High -11 or -12.\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT: Clear with cloudy periods, increasing cloud and a 50% chance of flurries overnight. Low near -18.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nSATURDAY: Cloudy with sunny periods. 40% chance of flurries during the morning and again during the night. High -11 or -12. Low near -16.\n\nSUNDAY: Sunny with cloudy periods, possible morning fog patches and increasing cloud late in the day. High near -9. Low near -13.\n\nMONDAY: Cloudy with sunny breaks, possible morning fog patches. High -6 or -7. Low near -11.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair confidence. There’s increased uncertainty of the positioning of the modified Arctic airmass and the resulting temperature and wind late today through Friday, the colder airmass could stall east of Fernie. All of the guidance also confines the chance of flurries east of Fernie late today and tonight, regardless the brief easterly push could produce a light dusting of snow. The colder/drier airmass still favours clearing overnight and Friday. A series of minor disturbances should drift southward along or just east of the Rockies late Friday night-early Saturday morning and again late Saturday-Saturday night. A temperature inversion should redevelop which could result in low cloud/fog and makes for some uncertainty of the local temperature again Sunday and Monday. The longer range guidance continues to seriously struggle with the weather pattern. Some solutions now suggest a slight chance of flurries Tuesday-Tuesday night and a greater chance of snow Wednesday. Others delay the chance of snow across southeastern BC until Friday.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
