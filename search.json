Sunny slopes may soften in the daytime, improving riding conditions. \n\nThe snowpack is generally stable; it may be appropriate to step out into more complex terrain.Small avalanches can have serious consequences in extreme terrain. Carefully evaluate your line for slabs before you commit to it.A hard crust on the snow surface will help strengthen the snowpack, but may cause tough travel conditions.\n\n    \nDanger Ratings\n\n\n\n\nElevation\nSunday\nMonday\nTuesday\n\n\n\n\nAlpine\n1 - Low\n1 - Low\n1 - Low\n\n\nTreeline\n1 - Low\n1 - Low\n1 - Low\n\n\nBelow Treeline\n1 - Low\n1 - Low\n1 - Low\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Confidence\n\n\nHIGH\n- \nWe are confident due to a stable weather pattern.\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see more detail on problems, snowpack and weather...\nProblems\nNo notable problems are currently reported.\n\nFurther Detail\nAvalanche Summary There are no new avalanche observations. Avalanche activity is considered unlikely, and the danger is expected to remain low until the weather pattern shifts to bring more precipitation. Keep sharing your photos and observations with the Mountain Information Network!\nSnowpack Summary A widespread layer of new surface hoar continues growing in the region. It is not currently a concern, but it may become problematic once it is buried by new snow.Otherwise, a firm surface crust caps the snowpack right to moutaintops, potentially melting slightly in the afternoons on directly sunny slopes. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled with several crust layers present, though none are affecting stability at this time. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Saturday NightMostly clear skies. 1 to 2 cm of snow possible in the Rockies. 20 km/h north ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -13 °C.SundayMostly sunny. 30 km/h west ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -12 °C.MondayMix of sun and clouds. 50 km/h west ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -10 °C.TuesdayMix of sun and clouds. 40 km/h west ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -9 °C. More details can be found in the Mountain Weather Forecast."

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Saturday January 24, 2025 11:15 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: A series of weak disturbances will drift southward along or just east of the Rockies for variable cloud and a 60-70% chance of flurries at times today and this evening. A drier northwesterly flow associated with a persistent upper ridge of high pressure centred off the coast should allow for clearing or partial clearing later tonight and dry, uneventful conditions Sunday and Sunday night. Low cloud and fog patches are likely at times.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface. \n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy, a few sunny breaks are possible. 60% chance of flurries. Windy at times, more so at the upper elevations. High near -11.\n\nTONIGHT: Mainly cloudy with a 70% chance of flurries during the evening. Minor accumulation possible. Clear with cloudy periods & possible fog patches overnight. Windy at times during the evening. Low near -16.\n\nSUNDAY: Possible low cloud and fog patches during the morning, otherwise mainly sunny. High near -9.\n\nSUNDAY NIGHT: Low cloud and fog patches, otherwise clear with cloudy periods. Low -13 or -14.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nMONDAY: Cloudy with fog patches and possible sunny breaks. Slight chance of flurries late in the day and Monday night. High near -7. Low -10 or -11.\n\nTUESDAY: Possible low cloud and fog patches, otherwise sunny with cloudy periods. High near -5. Low near -8.\n\nWEDNESDAY: Cloudy with sunny breaks, possible fog patches and a 40% chance of flurries. High -3 or -4. 40-60% chance of flurries Wednesday night. Low near -6.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair to good confidence of the synoptic pattern through Sunday night, fair Monday onward and also fair confidence of many local details during the shorter term. A stagnant airmass allowed a fairly extensive coverage of low cloud to develop across the area overnight. The low cloud could produce light flurries at times. The patchy mid level moisture in combination with the low cloud increases the chance of local flurries, more so this evening. Regardless any accumulation of snow would be very minor. A temperature inversion will redevelop which makes for some uncertainty of the local temperature again, more so Sunday onward. There’s also much uncertainty of the coverage of low cloud/fog, its depth and its persistence tonight through Tuesday or Wednesday. A weak upper disturbance could push eastward across Washington-Oregon for a slight chance of flurries late Monday and Monday night. Some computer models suggest a dissipating disturbance could push inland from the coast late Tuesday night and Wednesday, other solutions suggest a strong upper ridge of high pressure will persist Wednesday. The longer range guidance is still highly variable Wednesday night onward but some solutions still suggest a more eventful pattern will develop Friday or Saturday.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
