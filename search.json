Avalanche activity is considered unlikely, and the danger is expected to remain low until the weather pattern shifts to bring more precipitation. Keep sharing your photos and observations with the Mountain Information Network!\nSnowpack Summary A widespread layer of large surface hoar may be buried by 1 to 5 cm of snow. It is not currently a concern, but is expected to become problematic once it is buried by more snow. Below this, a firm surface crust caps the snowpack right to moutaintop, potentially melting slightly in the afternoons on directly sunny slopes. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled, with several crust layers present, though none are affecting stability at this time. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Sunday NightMostly clear skies. Alberta Rockies: 60 km/h west, otherwise 30 km/h southwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -11 °C.MondayMostly sunny. Alberta Rockies: 60 km/h west, otherwise 30 km/h southwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -10 °C.TuesdayMostly sunny. 40 km/h west ridgetop wind.

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Sunday January 25, 2025 11:00 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: High pressure (upper level gradually shifting inland from the coast and surface based of modified Arctic origin centred east of BC) should dominate to maintain relatively cold and uneventful conditions during the next few days. A redeveloping temperature inversion and stagnating low level airmass will allow for low cloud and fog patches at times. The low cloud could produce light flurries at times. Variable system related cloud is expected and there’s also a slight chance of flurries as a weak disturbance drifts over the upper area of high pressure Monday afternoon and Monday night.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface.\n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy with fog patches, possibly dissipating to sunny periods or mainly sunny skies during the afternoon. A few light flurries, mainly during the morning. High -11 or -12.\n\nTONIGHT: Cloudy with clear periods and fog patches. Possible light flurries. Low near -16.\n\nMONDAY: Cloudy with fog patches and possible sunny breaks. 40% chance of flurries, possible during the morning but mainly late in the day. High near -9.\n\nMONDAY NIGHT: Mainly cloudy with a 60% chance of flurries during the evening, minor accumulation possible. Cloudy with clear periods and possible fog patches overnight. Low near -14.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nTUESDAY: Possible low cloud and fog patches, otherwise mainly sunny. High near -6. Increasing cloud and a slight chance of flurries Tuesday night. Low -10 or -11.\n\nWEDNESDAY: Cloudy with sunny breaks and a slight chance of flurries. High near -4. Low -6 or -7.\n\nTHURSDAY: Mainly cloudy with a 60% chance of flurries. Windy at times. High near -3. Occasional snow possible late Thursday night. Low near -4.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair to good confidence of the synoptic pattern through Tuesday, poor to fair Tuesday night onward and also poor to fair confidence of the local sky condition and temperature during the shorter term. Once again there’s much uncertainty of the persistence of the low cloud/fog today and then where the low cloud will redevelop, its depth and persistence tonight through Tuesday night or Wednesday. The patchy mid level moisture in combination with the low cloud increases the chance of local flurries late Monday and Monday evening. The temperature inversion will trend deeper Monday and Tuesday. A series of dissipating disturbances should push inland from the coast late Tuesday night through Thursday. Most of the current guidance downplays the chance of any local snow, some solutions suggest a light dusting at times. A more substantial Pacific system is possible late Thursday night and Friday. \n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
