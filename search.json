    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Wednesday January 28, 2025 11:00 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: A weakening upper trough of low pressure will push eastward across southern BC for mainly cloudy skies and likely a few flurries at times today. Variable cloud is expected during the majority of tonight with patchy moisture embedded in a southwesterly flow aloft. The chance of flurries or possible occasional snow increases late overnight and more so Thursday and Thursday evening as another weakening system gradually pushes inland from the south coast. The temperature should continue to gradually trend milder.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Possibly rising slightly above surface this afternoon. Surface tonight. Rising to near 1100-1200 metres Thursday afternoon.\n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Mainly cloudy. 60% chance of flurries, mainly during the early afternoon. Minor accumulation possible. High near -2.\n\nTONIGHT: Cloudy with clear breaks and a slight chance of flurries, 60% chance of flurries developing near morning. Low near -5.\n\nTHURSDAY: Cloudy with a few flurries or occasional snow. Light accumulation, possible 2 to 8 cm. Slight chance of freezing rain. High near -1.\n\nTHURSDAY NIGHT: Mainly cloudy. A few flurries or occasional snow during the evening, 60% chance of flurries overnight. Minor to low end light accumulation possible. Low near -2.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nFRIDAY and FRIDAY NIGHT: Cloudy with occasional snow, easing off overnight. Rising snow level during the day. Light to low end moderate accumulation possible. Windy at times. High 0 or 1. Low near -2.\n\nSATURDAY: Sunny with cloudy periods. High 1 or 2. Increasing cloud and a slight chance of flurries Saturday night. Low -2 or -3.\n\nSUNDAY: Cloudy, possible morning fog patches and sunny periods. High near 1. 60% chance of flurries or occasional snow Sunday night, light accumulation possible. Low near -2.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair confidence. The computer models are increasingly variable with the timing and moisture content of the series of disturbances expected during the next few days. Some solutions still downplay the chance of any flurries today however based on a band of flurries across the Selkirks this morning a very minor amount of snow appears likely. The timing of the following disturbance has been advanced. Its moisture content is highly questionable as it should be drifting over an upper ridge of high pressure Thursday. Some guidance suggests a very minor amount of snow, other guidance is trending greater, thus the possible 2 to 8 cm. The moisture content of the third system still appears a bit more significant, its timing has also been advanced with precipitation developing early or mid morning Friday. An upper trough should follow the cold front for possible snow showers (greater rate of fall) Friday evening. The snow level will rise with the prolonged southwesterly flow, there’s a risk of it rising above 1500-1600 metres Friday. High pressure should briefly rebuild over southern BC Saturday. Another Pacific system could clip the area Saturday night and have greater influence late Sunday and Sunday night.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
