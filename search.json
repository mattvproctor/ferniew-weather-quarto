Small wind slabs may lurk in isolated areas where upper elevations hold dry snow. Otherwise, avalanche activity is unlikely where a thick surface crust exists.\nSnowpack Summary Surface crust exists at most elevations due to recent rain and warm temperatures. Below this, the upper snowpack is slowly drying out with colder temperatures. Multiple crusts are present in the mid and lower snowpack, which is dense and well-settled. The average snowpack depth at treeline is roughly 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Sunday NightClear skies. 20 km/h west ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -5 °C. Freezing level 500 m.MondayMostly sunny. 30 km/h northwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -5 °C. Freezing level 500 m.TuesdayMostly sunny. 40 km/h northwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -7 °C. WednesdayMostly sunny. 30 km/h west ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -8 °C. More details can be found in the Mountain Weather Forecast."

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Monday January 19, 2025 11:00 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: Patchy moisture drifting south-southeastward across Alberta should result in a few bands of cloud or cloudy periods today and a slight chance of flurries tonight and early Tuesday. Otherwise a strong upper ridge of high pressure centred just off the coast should maintain dry, rather uneventful conditions during the next few days. A stagnant low level airmass will allow for low cloud and fog at times, more so during the morning and overnight hours. The low cloud could produce a few snow flakes at times.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface, possibly rising slightly above surface this afternoon. A deep temperature inversion should persist today and dissipate some tonight.\n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy with fog patches, possibly dissipating to sunny periods or mainly sunny skies during the afternoon. High near -5.\n\nTONIGHT: Cloudy with clear periods, possible fog patches and a slight chance of flurries overnight. Increased wind overnight, more so at the upper elevations. Low near -12.\n\nTUESDAY: Variable cloud, possible fog patches and a slight chance of flurries during the morning. Clearing during the afternoon. Windy at times. High -5 or -6.\n\nTUESDAY NIGHT: Clear with cloudy periods. Increasing wind overnight. Low -13 or -14.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nWEDNESDAY: Sunny with cloudy periods, slight chance of low cloud and fog patches during the morning. High -6 or -7. Low -15 or -16.\n\nTHURSDAY: A mix of sun & cloud. Windy. High near -9. Slight chance of flurries Thursday night. Low near -18.\n\nFRIDAY: Sunny with a few bands of cloud. Possibly windy at times. High near -10. Low near -18.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair to good confidence of the synoptic pattern through Wednesday night. Fair Thursday onward and also still fair confidence of the local temperature and sky condition during the shorter term. Limited mid-high level moisture is currently drifting southward across the area which should clear before noon however it’s difficult to determine if the lower cloud/fog will also dissipate this afternoon. Persistent low cloud/fog would result in a colder than currently predicted temperature today. All of the current guidance confines the chance of flurries east of Fernie tonight and early Tuesday. A colder airmass should gradually push southward from Yukon-northern BC Tuesday night through Thursday night or Friday. This colder/drier airmass reduces the chance of low cloud/fog. The most recent computer models downplay the chance of any flurries Thursday night and also now maintain a dry northerly flow through Sunday. The longer range guidance is highly variable, some solutions suggest light snow is possible late Sunday night-Monday.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
