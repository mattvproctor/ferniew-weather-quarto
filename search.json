Deeper in the snowpack, a handful of crust layers persist, though none are affecting stability at this time. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Tuesday NightMostly clear skies. 30 km/h west ridgetop wind.

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Tuesday January 20, 2025 11:15 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: A stagnant low level airmass/trapped low level moisture will allow for low cloud and fog patches again today and possibly at times tonight through Wednesday night. Clearing or partial clearing is possible this afternoon or evening and more likely Wednesday. Otherwise very little change is expected as high pressure (upper level gradually collapsing westward off the coast and now more so surface based of modified Arctic origin slowly building southward from the Yukon) continues to dominate the weather pattern. The temperature should begin to trend colder, more so Wednesday-Thursday.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface. A temperature inversion should persist, the milder layer likely above 2200-2300 metres today.\n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy with fog patches, possibly dissipating to sunny periods or mainly sunny skies during the afternoon. High near -6.\n\nTONIGHT: Possible low cloud and fog patches, otherwise clear with cloudy periods. Low near -13.\n\nWEDNESDAY: Possible low cloud and fog patches, otherwise sunny with a few bands of cloud. High -7 or -8.\n\nWEDNESDAY NIGHT: Clear with cloudy periods, possible low cloud and fog patches overnight. Low -14 or -15.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nTHURSDAY: Sunny with cloudy periods. Windy. High near -10. Low near -20.\n\nFRIDAY: Mainly sunny. Possibly windy at times. High near -13. Low near -20.\n\nSATURDAY: A mix of sun & cloud. High near -11. Low near -18.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair to good confidence of the synoptic pattern through Friday night. Poor to fair Saturday onward and also poor to fair confidence of the local temperature and sky condition. As is typical with high pressure during the winter months it’s very difficult to accurately predicted where and when low cloud/fog will develop, how deep it’ll be and then how persistent it’ll be. Low cloud can produce light flurries at times. A drier northeasterly flow associated with the surface based area of high pressure reduces the chance of low cloud/fog, mainly Wednesday onward. A tightening pressure gradient could result in significant wind at times Thursday afternoon through Friday. The longer range guidance is still highly variable and more changes are very likely. Some solutions now suggest a slight chance of flurries Saturday night and then a greater chance of light snow beginning as early as Monday afternoon or as late as Wednesday.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
