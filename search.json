Avalanche activity is considered unlikely, and the danger is expected to remain low until the weather pattern shifts to bring more precipitation. Keep sharing your photos and observations with the Mountain Information Network!\nSnowpack Summary A widespread layer of large surface hoar can be found on the surface or thinly buried by a few centimetres of recent snow. It is not currently a concern, but it is expected to become problematic once it is buried by enough snow.  Below this, a firm surface crust caps the snowpack right to moutaintop, potentially melting slightly in the afternoons on directly sunny slopes. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled, with several crust layers present, though none are affecting stability at this time. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Monday NightPartly cloudy. 30 km/h west ridgetop wind, except Alberta Rockies 60 km/h west. Treeline temperature -9 °C.TuesdaySunny. 25 km/h west ridgetop wind, except Alberta Rockies 45 km/h west. Treeline temperature -7 °C.WednesdayMostly cloudy. 40 km/h west ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -6 °C.ThursdayCloudy. 1 to 5 cm of snow. 50 km/h southwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -6 °C. More details can be found in the Mountain Weather Forecast."

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Monday January 26, 2025 11:00 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: A minor disturbance will drift over an upper ridge of high pressure for variable cloud today and a chance of flurries late today and more so tonight. High pressure should be of greater influence Tuesday and the majority of Tuesday night, fairly sunny/clear skies are possible however a patchy or extensive coverage of low cloud and fog is also possible. Patchy moisture entrained in a developing southwesterly flow aloft should result in increasing or thickening cloud late Tuesday night.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface.\n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy with sunny breaks. 30% chance of late day flurries. Windy at times at the upper elevations. High -7 or -8.\n\nTONIGHT: Mainly cloudy with a 60% chance of flurries. Minor accumulation possible. Possible clearing late overnight. Low -10 or -11.\n\nTUESDAY: Possible low cloud and fog patches, otherwise sunny with cloudy periods. High near -5.\n\nTUESDAY NIGHT: Cloudy with clear periods and fog patches, increasing cloud overnight. Low -9 or -10.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nWEDNESDAY: Cloudy with sunny breaks and a 50% chance of flurries. High near -3. Low -5 or -6.\n\nTHURSDAY: Mainly cloudy with a few flurries. High -1 or -2. A few flurries or occasional snow and increased wind Thursday night. Light accumulation of snow possible. Low -2 or -3.\n\nFRIDAY and FRIDAY NIGHT: Cloudy with occasional snow or a few flurries. Light accumulation possible. Windy at times. High near 0. Low near -2.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair to good confidence of the synoptic pattern through Tuesday, fair Tuesday night onward. Poor to fair confidence of some local details during the shorter term. There appears to be a minimal coverage of low cloud/fog across the area this morning. Mid and high level cloud cover associated with today’s minor disturbance should be of broken coverage initially. Some guidance confines the chance of flurries just north of Fernie late today and tonight. Once again there’s much uncertainty of the coverage of low cloud/fog, its depth and persistence tonight through Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. The temperature inversion will trend deeper tonight and Tuesday. A southwesterly flow should finally develop Tuesday night. A series of disturbances should then push inland from the coast late Tuesday night through Friday night. The initial disturbances are suggested to largely dissipate before they reach the Rockies. Changes are very possible however Thursday night-Friday morning and then Friday night currently appear most promising for light accumulations of snow.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
