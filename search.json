Continue to assess conditions and exercise normal caution, especially in committing avalanche terrain.\n\nAvalanche activity is unlikely when a thick melt-freeze crust is present on the snow surface.The snowpack is generally stable; it may be appropriate to step out into more complex terrain.Small avalanches can have serious consequences in extreme terrain.

Avalanche activity is considered unlikely until the current weather pattern shifts.  If you head to the backcountry, consider sharing your photos and observations with the Mountain Information Network!\nSnowpack Summary A widespread layer of new surface hoar is growing in the region. It is not currently a concern, but it may become problematic once it is buried by new snow.Otherwise, a firm surface crust caps the snowpack, potentially melting slightly in the afternoon on directly sunny slopes. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled with several crust layers present, though none are affecting stability at this time. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Friday NightClear skies. 30 km/h northwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -14 °C.SaturdayMix of sun and clouds. 30 km/h northwest ridgetop wind. Treeline temperature -12 °C.SundayMostly sunny. 30 km/h northwest ridgetop wind.

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Friday January 23, 2025 11:00 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: Surface based high pressure of modified Arctic origin centred east of the Rockies will dominate for dry, mainly sunny/clear conditions today and into the evening. A series of minor disturbances/patchy moisture should drift southward along or just east of the Rockies for variable cloud or cloudy periods and a slight chance of flurries at times late tonight, Saturday and Saturday evening. High pressure favours clearing skies again later Saturday night. The temperature will be a few degrees colder.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface. \n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Mainly sunny. Possibly windy at times. High -10 or -11.\n\nTONIGHT: Clear with cloudy periods during the evening. Variable cloud or cloudy periods and a 30% chance of flurries overnight. Low -15 or -16.\n\nSATURDAY: Cloudy with sunny periods or sunny breaks and a 30% chance of flurries. High -10 or -11.\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT: Cloudy with clear breaks and a 40% chance of flurries during the evening. Clearing overnight. Possibly windy at times. Low -17 or -18.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nSUNDAY: Sunny with a few bands of cloud or cloudy periods. Possibly windy at times. High near -10. Low near -15.\n\nMONDAY: Cloudy with sunny periods and possible morning fog patches. High near -7. Slight chance of flurries Monday night. Low -10 or -11.\n\nTUESDAY: Possible low cloud and fog patches, otherwise sunny with cloudy periods. High -5 or -6. Low near -8.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Good confidence today, fair tonight onward. There’s some uncertainty of the exact positioning of the modified Arctic airmass and the resulting temperature today through Saturday night or Sunday. All of the guidance still confines the chance of flurries east of Fernie tonight, Saturday and Saturday night however the weak easterly surface flow could still result a few flurries at times. A temperature inversion should redevelop which could result in low cloud/fog and makes for some uncertainty of the local temperature again, more so Sunday night through Tuesday. A weak upper disturbance could push eastward across Washington-Oregon for a slight chance of flurries Monday night. The longer range guidance is still highly variable, more changes are very likely. Some solutions now suggest a slight chance of flurries Wednesday night and Thursday and then a 60% chance of light snow at times Thursday night and Friday. Some hint at a slightly more significant Pacific system late Friday night-Saturday.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
