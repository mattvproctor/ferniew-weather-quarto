It is not currently a concern, but it may become problematic once buried by new snow.Otherwise, a firm surface crust caps the snowpack, potentially melting slightly in the afternoon on directly sunny slopes. The mid and lower snowpack is dense and well-settled with several crust layers present, though none are affecting stability at this time. The average snowpack depth at treeline is 150 to 200 cm.\nWeather Summary Wednesday NightMostly clear skies with valley cloud possible. 20 km/h northwest ridgetop wind.

    "text": "Lakeman’s Lookout\nThe following snippet is taken from the Mountain Forecast section of FAR’s website. Bear in mind that it will be up to 24 hours old by the time you read it! Many thanks as always to Ron Lakeman for his hard work.\n\n\n\nMountain Weather Report\n\n\nISSUED: Wednesday January 21, 2025 10:30 MST\n\nSYNOPSIS: A dry northwesterly flow aloft associated with an upper ridge of high pressure centred off the coast and more so surface based high pressure of modified Arctic origin gradually pushing southward from the Yukon-northern Alberta should maintain rather uneventful conditions during the next few days. Low cloud and fog patches should persist, some clearing or limited clearing is possible. The wind should increase and there’s a slight chance of flurries as the leading edge of the colder Arctic airmass pushes just west of the Continental Divide Thursday afternoon and Thursday night.\n\nFREEZING LEVEL: Surface. \n\nFERNIE ALPINE RESORT FORECAST (1615 metres):\n\nTODAY: Cloudy with fog patches, possibly dissipating to sunny periods during the afternoon. High near -7.\n\nTONIGHT: Low cloud and fog patches, possible clear periods. Low near -11.\n\nTHURSDAY: Cloudy with morning fog patches, possible afternoon sunny breaks or sunny periods. Increasing wind during the afternoon. Slight chance of late day flurries. High -7 or -8.\n\nTHURSDAY NIGHT: Cloudy with clear periods and a slight chance of flurries. Windy. Low near -20.\n\nOUTLOOK:\n\nFRIDAY: Mainly sunny. Windy at times, mainly during the morning. High -13 or -14. Variable cloud or cloudy periods and a 40% chance of flurries Friday night. Low near -20.\n\nSATURDAY: A mix of sun & cloud, slight chance of morning flurries. High near -12. Low near -18.\n\nSUNDAY: A mix of sun & cloud, increasing cloud possible during the afternoon. High near -9. Low near -15.\n\nCONFIDENCE/DISCUSSION: Fair to good confidence of the synoptic pattern through Friday. Fair Friday night onward and also fair confidence of the local temperature and sky condition during the shorter term. There’s still some uncertainty of the coverage of the low cloud/fog, its depth and persistence during the next several days. The low cloud could produce light flurries at times. Partial or limited clearing of the low cloud is possible this afternoon and again Thursday. The colder/drier airmass should allow for greater clearing late Thursday night and Friday. A minor disturbance is currently suggested to drift southward along or just east of the Rockies Friday night-early Saturday morning. Some guidance suggests another minor disturbance could skirt just east of Fernie late Saturday-Saturday night. A temperature inversion should persist however it should be less evident during the next couple of days, it should deepen again during the weekend. The longer range guidance is still highly variable and more changes are very likely. Some solutions suggest an increased chance of flurries Monday night, others hint at high pressure rebuilding.\n\n \n\nRon Lakeman."
